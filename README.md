📌 K-Means Clustering: Customer Segmentation
This project demonstrates one of the simplest yet most powerful clustering techniques — K-Means Clustering. Despite its simplicity, K-Means is widely used across various fields for discovering patterns and grouping unlabeled data.
In this notebook, we walk through how K-Means can be applied to perform customer segmentation, a common real-world use case in data-driven businesses.
